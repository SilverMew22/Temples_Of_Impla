<h1 class="header">Temples of Impla</h1>
	<div id="box_img_gal">
<img src="Crystal_cave.jpg" height="300px"/><p>These underground caves
serve as a feeding ground for Greed imps. Seeing as these caves are dispersed
underground. The Greed imps must aqurire a lot of wealth, to buy them for their
raw minerals. These caves are not effected by the weather above ground.</p>
<img src="fall_forest.jpg" height="300px"/><p>The days are
colder and there is less to harvest. The imps use the dead leaves, as fuel
for their home's fires. As the trees begin to rest, the imps thank them for
their gifts (leaves, wood, fruit, ect.) These days are known as the 'Wilting Season of Change'.</p>
<img src="forest_spring.jpg" height="300px"/>
<p>The ice that has blanketed the forest has melted away. This river
is located between the Gluttonous and Lust imp territory. The green of the
forest is an ideal place to find fresh herbs for medicine.</p>
<img src="pom_tree.jpg" height="300px"/><p>They harvest half of
the fruits, levaing some back for the forset. Fruits are preserved in magical
jars that can preserve fruits for 100+ years. This leaves the forest more
and more abundent every year.</p>
        <img src="forest_summer.jpg" height="300px"/><p>The woods
		during summer are hot and lush with trees, it is easy to get lost
		with all of the new greenery covering the dirt roads. Projects are
		created by the player to make permanent road that can be travered
		by imps and not obscured by the forest.</p>
<img src="forest_winter.jpg" height="300px"/><p>Now that the snow
has fallen, the land is asleep (unable to produce crops). The imps can
take a break to find wood to warm their house. The Lust imps who own
cloth shops have a bomb in sales, selling clothes for travelling imps.</p>
<img src="forest_bar.jpg" height="300px"/>
<p>The imps of Pride live in a colorless, monochromal world. Their skys
are covered in clouds, giving off shades of gray. The forest's trees
resemble hands from the soil, due to the trees feeding from the imp's
diety; the Pride imp's diety is the imp of the underworld. No Pride imp
has ever seen the blue of the sky or the setting sun.</p>
