	<p class="box">Their eyes are a lovely shade of
	purple, with the ability to control the plants around them. Their
	love of beautiful things like flowers and high-quality cloths drives them
	adapt to a lifestyle of narcissistic needs. They need to be just as
	beautiful as the plants they tend to be happy, but Pretar, a
        lust imp with a scar, wonders if this is true.</p>

        <p id="box">The Lustful imps turned their obsessive
		fixations on things, into potions that can lead and
		distract monsters and animals. Their bodies are also
		composed of plant matter, and pollen (produced by males)
		can help other plants and flowers grow. Their obsessive
		natures for focusing on their needs leads them to regrow
		trees in deforested areas with their pollen and control
		over animals helps animals stay calm as they either lead
		them back into to forest or herd them away for farming.
		They are all vegetarians, due to their inability to take
		life, as they desire to see things live and dead things
		lack desire and passion. They admire the Wrathful impsâ€™
		abilities to dive in head first and give there all, the
		greedy imps fixation on acquiring wealth fascinates them but
		the Slothful imps annoy them with their lack of motivation
		and passive natures.
