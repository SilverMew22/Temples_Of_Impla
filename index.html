        <p><b>Dream Job</b><i>: 3d Game Assets Modeler.</i></p>
        <p>My name is Sheuqna Garnett and I am a quiet, reserved person who can daydream for hours; I think about my fantasy realms, creating characters, their personalities, powers, systems/societies that they live in, religion, deities, biomes and storylines for fun. When I finally think of something really good/new, I write/draw it so I can expand on it later.

        <h4>Title:<br/> <i>Temples of Impla</i></h4>
        <p>My site will be about my current game in progress. <i><b>‘Temples of Impla’.</b></i>
            The top of my website will have a row of roll-over buttons like home, concept art, characters with a drop down menu of all the characters, game so far <i>(a beta version of my game)</i>, contact <i>(my email/ a comments section).</i>
The page will have all of the characters so far, their behaviors, beliefs, a design of their home/village/city. The background will either be the map of their world, with a color overlay of the character’s fur, that page is about or an object in a repeated array that is special to that character’s life, as to not distract from the content of the page.
