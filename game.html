        In this universe, little imps have built a society on a remote island. The humans. after discoveng their world have tried to wage war or ally themselves with the imps, for their advanced technology and rare resources. However the little creatures felt about the humans, the imps could not go near them, or their physical and mental state would be altered by their pressence. The humans still tried to fight their own kind and the imps, until the creatures, out of fear for themselves and the humans, cut off all contact. 100 years later, there was a collosal boom and the world outside of the lone island became covered in a dark mist and was no more.</br>

                Now the peacful little island, is surrounded by an errie world that wishes to consume them. And out of that strange, human world, comes problems that the little imps don't know how to solve.    </br>

        Seven little imps wish to cast aside fear, leave their villages and discover more about their world and what happened to the humans, while trying to appease the wishes of their villages.</p>

<p class="box">The characters are all imps (
		tiny mischievous devils) who were all representing
		the vices of mankind also known as the seven deadly sins.
		With no humans to torment and influence, they decide to find
		positive attributes to their vices. The build villages that
		cater to their ideas and realized that the other villages not
		only have different views, but resources that can help them.
		No other vice is stronger than the other, so they begin to
		trade with one another to avoid conflict and learn from one another.
		They begin to diversify their own villages, realizing that
		with different influences and points of views, their own
		lives can grow. However, some richer imps like greed
		and gluttony tend to take advantage of the poorer imps,
		like sloth and wrath imps, who live in less ideal places,
		by pushing them out by hoarding resources and isolating the imps
		in certain villages, like pride, who do not wish to interact with
		the other imps due to their drastic cultural difference and beliefs.</p>
