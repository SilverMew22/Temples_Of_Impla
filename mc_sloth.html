	<p class="box">The Slothful imps are in a permanent
	state of rest and rarely move on their own. They lack
	motivation and are actually closely related to Wrathful
	and Lustful imps. They are very hard on themselves for
	being unable to contribute to the other imps, their mind
	so plagued with self-doubt and lack of purpose, they lay
	there, thinking of all the things they want to do, but
	can’t due to their vice. Other imps cannot communicate
	with them easily and view them as being lazy, further
	driving the barely functioning imps into a state of aware
	vegetation. They have a lot of potential that they cannot
	tap into without support from another imp and are good at
	mundane labor that does not acquire ambition. They’re
	bodies are soft, fluffy and limber due to their lack of
	movement, lack of self-care and low muscle density.
Higher functioning sloth imps are strongly telepathic
and can move their limbs with their minds/telepathy, because of their,
their more aware of subtle changes in the environment, through their bodies,
with their mind reacting quicker than their body can.

to enjoy them.</p>

of the softest, prised materials in Impla. They are used to make high-quality materials
like pillows and cloth for wrapping wounds. Some Sloth Imps and taken away from their
village in the dead of night for this wool. Wrath Imps have stepped in to oversee their
safty.</p>
