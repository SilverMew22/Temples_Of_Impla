<p id="box">Prideful imps are monochromic, their bodies
are either black or white. Their need to be self-sufficient
drives them to use the bones of their ancestors and relatives
to create potions and weapons to fight with. They also are held
in high regard, due to the bones, they wear on their bodies that
come from the imp graveyard, where the grand imp of death lays.
Their abilities allow them to take a bone from their body
and grow a new one in its place. Their bodies are incapable of
remaining incomplete as their unwavering will in their abilities
have made them almost indestructible are less fearful of
death. Their lands are barren on only have bones, so they really
see anything with a color other than the colors in the sky. Anything
that is not a monochromic color, that ventures into their territory
is killed off, due to the imp of death feeding off of the vibrant
colorful life coming from that creature. The Prideful imps are
immune to this treatment and keet the grand imp of death starved
of life, to keep it contained. The very fact that their vigilance
over their land, halts the destruction of all of Impla, give them a
lot of pride and makes them arrogant. The Prideful imps will only
tolerate the company of other races of imps if they can be the leader
and call the shots. Imps that leave the graveyard, like the imps the
player has, are seen as lesser than the imps in the graveyard,
by said imp. The imps that leave contribute their bodieâ€™s magical
healing properties to other imps, and despite their conceded
attitudes, are welcomed by the other races of imps.
