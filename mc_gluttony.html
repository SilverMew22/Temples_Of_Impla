				<p id="box">The Gluttonous imps love to learn new things
				and enjoy the resources around them. They have no sense of moderation,
				as they live in the moment and consume everything with second though, be it
				food to a whole library, they can become deeply immersed in
				trying to understand, gain and digest things. They are quite powerful
				as their strength is let out in uncontrollable, leaks in their power.
				A single punch meant for a rock can carve away a section of a mountain.
				They carry jugs that hold their excess power, or hold resources and and
				good at finding resources, but only ones similar to what they’ve found before.
				They love rounded structured due to their need to stuff their goods into the large
				jugs with a nook or cranny left of spec to cram in more. Gluttonous imps have a lot of
				health, due to their great attention to consuming as many beneficial items as possible,
				but can also be ‘gluttons for punishment’ and never know when to stop acts that could
				kill them, not knowing how to use self-control. Their life expectancy is a bit longer
				than Wrathful imps, due to the Gluttonous imps graining mass amounts of knowledge,
				but rarely put it to use.</p>
