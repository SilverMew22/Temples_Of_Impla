		<p id="box">Greedy imps are very straightforward,
		they eat metals, gems, and precious stones and are seen
		wearing these items on their bodies. Other imps think
		they are showing off, but this is not the case,
		they wear their wealth because they need to keep consuming
		mineral deposits to survive. They are viewed as being greedy,
		due to their possession of food items and other resources that
		they don’t need and therefore trade away for high prices.
		They don’t need to eat all the fruit they found, but they know
		another imp that does and that is their motivation to find as
		many resources as possible, to trade away for their food of
		choice, gold, metal, and gems.</p>
