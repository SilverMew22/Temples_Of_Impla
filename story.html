        <p class="box">The characters are all imps (
		tiny mischievous devils) who were all representing
		the vices of mankind also known as the seven deadly sins.
		With no humans to torment and influence, they decide to find
		positive attributes to their vices. The build villages that
		cater to their ideas and realized that the other villages not
		only have different views, but resources that can help them.
		No other vice is stronger than the other, so they begin to
		trade with one another to avoid conflict and learn from one another.
		They begin to diversify their own villages, realizing that
		with different influences and points of views, their own
		lives can grow. However, some richer imps like greed
		and gluttony tend to take advantage of the poorer imps,
		like sloth and wrath imps, who live in less ideal places,
		by pushing them out by hoarding resources and isolating the imps
		in certain villages, like pride, who do not wish to interact with
		the other imps due to their drastic cultural difference and beliefs.
