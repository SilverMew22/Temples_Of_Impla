	<p id="box">The Wrathful
	imps like to venture out and fight strong opponents.
	They can also be fighters for hire and can reside
	in a village to help protect other imps. They turned
	their rage and inability to show mercy into a form of
	justice that they dispense upon the monsters and unjust
	imps. They are pretty much neutral to everyone, until other
	imps try to antagonize them; they kick, bite, head-butt, and scratch
	even until after the other imp tries to flee. They tend to have
	short tempers but they will warn you first if you are making
	them irritable. Wrath imps are good at destroying old
	buildings, being bodyguards and truing rocks into
	pebbles for decorations. Every punch and kick is
	premeditated and thrown with skill and precision, however,
	they have a higher chance of dying due to their inability
	to back down from conflicts and need medicine from the
	Prideful imps. Lustful imps can calm down their
	obsession with violence.</p>
