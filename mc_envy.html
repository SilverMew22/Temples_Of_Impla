		The Envious imps are all green with different shades of green eyes.
		They are only jealous of other green items, so to stay in their good graces,
		keep the color green out of their sight. These imps do not like each other and are spiteful of how green
		another imp is. They have the ability to copy nature’s abilities and use them for a while and their
		bodies are made from a plant like fiber that can change their body density, strength, speed, and their whole biology, to adjust to the element of their choice.
		They love to collect things that are green only, even if they can’t use it. They don’t really like the other races
		of imps, but tolerate them due to their need to trade for more green materials. An envious imp is the only imp that can have
		green eyes, but their bodies can vary in color from time to time. This is how other imps can tell that an imp will have
		spiteful tendencies, to want what the other imps have, in terms of abilities like speed and strength.
